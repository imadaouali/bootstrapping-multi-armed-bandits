# bootstrapping-multi-armed-bandits
Multi-Armed bandits have attracted a lot of attention in various applications, from recommender systems and information retrieval to healthcare and finance, due to their performance, their simplicity and properties such as learning from partial feed back. Bootstrapping is a powerful, computer-based method for statistical inference. It is a resampling method which samples independently with replacement from an existing sample data with same sample size n, and performing inference among these resampled data. Two recent papers proposed Bootstrap-based approaches for multi-armed bandit problems. This notebook aims to provide a comprehensive review of the use of Bootstrapping in multi-armed bandit problems by contrasting those approaches and discussing their benefits compared to other bandit approaches like UCB, kl-UCB, and Thompson Sampling.
